-- Benchmarks and Suites


{-| Benchmarks that contain potential, in-progress, and completed runs.

To make these, try [`benchmark`](#benchmark), [`describe`](#describe), or
[`compare`](#compare)
-}
type alias Benchmark =
    Internal.Benchmark


{-| Set the expected runtime for a [`Benchmark`](#Benchmark). This is the
default method of determining benchmark run size.

For example, to set the expected runtime to 1 second (away from the default of 5
seconds):

    benchmark1 "list head" List.head [1] |> withRuntime Time.second

This works with all the kinds of benchmarks you can create. If you provide a
composite benchmark (a group or comparison) the same expected runtime will be
set for all members.

Note that this sets the *expected* runtime, not *actual* runtime. We take a
small number of samples, then extrapolate to fit. This means that the actual
benchmarking runs will not fit *exactly* within the given time, but we should be
fairly close. In practice, expect actual runtime to deviate up to about 30%.
However, these actual runtimes should be fairly consistent between runs. NB:
Larger expected runtimes tend to yield more accurate actual runtimes.

            Internal.Compare name
                (withRuntime time a)
                (withRuntime time b)


{-| Set the exact number of runs to benchmarked. For example, to run a function
1 million times:

    benchmark1 "list head" List.head [1] |> withRuns 1000000

Doing this is generally not necessary; the runtime-based estimator will provide
consistent and reasonable results for all sizes of benchmarks without you having
to account for benchmark size or environmental concerns.

-- Creation


{-| Group a number of benchmarks together. Grouping benchmarks using `describe`
will never effect measurement, only organization.

You'll typically have at least one call to this in your benchmark program, at
the top level:

    describe "your program"
        [ -- all your benchmarks
        ]
-}
describe : String -> List Benchmark -> Benchmark
describe =
    Internal.Group


{-| Benchmark a function.

The first argument to the benchmark* functions is the name of the thing you're
measuring.

    benchmark "list head" (\_ -> List.head [1])

`benchmark1` through `benchmark8` have a nicer API which doesn't force you to
define anonymous functions. For example, the benchmark above can be defined as:

    benchmark1 "list head" List.head [1]
-}
benchmark : String -> (() -> a) -> Benchmark
benchmark name fn =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation fn)


{-| Benchmark a function with a single argument.

    benchmark1 "list head" List.head [1]

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark1 : String -> (a -> b) -> a -> Benchmark
benchmark1 name fn a =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation1 fn a)


{-| Benchmark a function with two arguments.

    benchmark2 "dict get" Dict.get "a" (Dict.singleton "a" 1)

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark2 : String -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> Benchmark
benchmark2 name fn a b =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation2 fn a b)


{-| Benchmark a function with three arguments.

    benchmark3 "dict insert" Dict.insert "b" 2 (Dict.singleton "a" 1)

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark3 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d) -> a -> b -> c -> Benchmark
benchmark3 name fn a b c =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation3 fn a b c)


{-| Benchmark a function with four arguments.

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark4 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d -> e) -> a -> b -> c -> d -> Benchmark
benchmark4 name fn a b c d =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation4 fn a b c d)


{-| Benchmark a function with five arguments.

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark5 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f) -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> Benchmark
benchmark5 name fn a b c d e =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation5 fn a b c d e)


{-| Benchmark a function with six arguments.

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark6 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g) -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> Benchmark
benchmark6 name fn a b c d e f =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation6 fn a b c d e f)


{-| Benchmark a function with seven arguments.

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark7 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h) -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> Benchmark
benchmark7 name fn a b c d e f g =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation7 fn a b c d e f g)


{-| Benchmark a function with eight arguments.

See the docs for [`benchmark`](#benchmark) for why this exists.
-}
benchmark8 : String -> (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i) -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> Benchmark
benchmark8 name fn a b c d e f g h =
    Internal.benchmark name (LowLevel.operation8 fn a b c d e f g h)


{-| Specify that two benchmarks are meant to be directly compared.

As with [`benchmark`](#benchmark), the first argument is the name for the
comparison.

    compare "initialize"
        (benchmark2 "HAMT" HAMT.initialize 10000 identity)
        (benchmark2 "Core" Array.initialize 10000 identity)
