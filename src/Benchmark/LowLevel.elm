single function call.

Create these using `operation` through `operation8` and take runtime samples
using `sample`.

Measure the run time of a function.

{-| Create an operation.

This uses Thunks, which come with a certain amount of runtime overhead. Prefer
using `operation1` through `operation8` if you can; they will give you more
accurate results.

See docs for [`operation`](#operation).
